    [your mount&blade sceneobj ex/importer of choice]
    
   
  Tell me more
  ---------------
  
  Me, a modder guy called Swyter made these small apps that wrap around all the
  complexity of the scoUtils lib. Use this to convert back and forth between 
  the Mount&Blade scenes format and your conventional image format of choice.
  
  
  This app supports a good bunch of commonly used file types, like:
  * PNG (8-bit)
  * TGA 
  * BMP
  * JPG(not recommended)
  
  
  Also imports in:
  * PSD
  * ...
  
  
  How to use them
  ------------------
  
  Well, just use the compiled programs and drop over the SCO file, it will do
  all the hard stuff for you. Detecting the file, loading it and exporting it
  into a cute image in the same folder, with a similar nomemclature.
